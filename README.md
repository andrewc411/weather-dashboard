# Weather Dashboard
## Description
This web application allows the user to search any city. Using openweathermap's one call API, data is obtained and populates the UI, so the user can view the current weather of that city as well as the forecast for the next upcoming 5 days. The weather dashboard saves your past searches. Displays them dynamically underneath the search bar as buttons that the user can click on to alternate between previously searched cities.
## User Story
